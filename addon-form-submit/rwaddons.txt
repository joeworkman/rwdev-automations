stack::360 Degree::360 Degree allows you to show off your products with a 360Â° view. You could even use it to make some still motion video! All of this is accomplished through combining multiple images into a sequence. As you hover your mouse over, 360 will smoothly transition between each image conveying its smooth animation.::image::9.95::/Users/joeworkman/Documents/Development/Web-Projects/Websites/joeworkman.net/depot/site-images/products/360-degree/360-degree@512.png::http://joeworkman.net/rapidweaver/stacks/360-degree::http://joeworkman.net/rapidweaver/stacks/360-degree:: ::http://joeworkman.net/rapidweaver/stacks/360-degree::https://vimeo.com/30751061::2014-09-24::2.1.8::218::com.joeworkman.stacks.fancy-image.360::### 2.1.8 <small>9/22/2014</small>\n\n* Removed all comments from code\n* New meta tags for stack version tracking\n* Getting ready for ************ launch\n\n\n\n#### 2.1.7 (8/2/2013)\n\n1.
